\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} purpose of this experiment is to investigate the patterns produced by single slit diffraction and double slit interference, and to verify that the minima and maxima occur respectively at the locations predicted by theory.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Single Slit}
In the case of a single slit, the angle  between the slit and the minima in the diffraction pattern is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:min}
	a\sin\theta = m\lambda.
\end{equation}
, where $a$ is the slit width and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident light.

Since this angle is small, we make the approximation that
\begin{equation*}
	\sin\theta \approx \tan\theta,
\end{equation*}

and from the geometry of the experimental setup, we find that
\begin{equation*}
	\tan\theta = \frac{y}{D},
\end{equation*}
where $y$ is the distance from the center to the $m$th minimum, and $D$ is the distance from the slit to the screen.

Substituting this into Equation~\ref{eq:min} gives the following expression for the slit width,
\begin{align}\label{eq:single_slit_width}
	a = \frac{m\lambda D}{y}, \qquad  m\in\mathbb{N}.
\end{align}

\subsection{Double Slit}
In the case of two slits, the angle to the $m$th maxima in the interference pattern is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:double_slit}
	d\sin\theta = m\lambda,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the distance between the slits.

The small angle approximation is again used, and trigonometry shows that
\begin{align*}
	\tan\theta = \frac{y}{D},
\end{align*}
which after substitution yields the following expression for the slit separation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dbl_slit_distance}
	d = \frac{m\lambda D}{y}, \qquad m\in\mathbb{N}.
\end{equation}

\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{For the single slit, does the distance between minima increase of decrease when the slit width is increased?}

	As the slit width increases, the diffraction patterns gets narrower and the center maximum at $m=0$ grows brighter. If the slit width is decreased, the pattern is stretched out, and the symmetric minimums and maximums grow further apart. Alternatively, Equation~\ref{eq:single_slit_width} shows that $a$ and $y$ are inversely proportional to each other. Therefore, increasing $a$ tends to decrease $y$, which says that wider slits produce narrower distances between minima.

	\item \textit{For the double slit:}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textit{How does the distance between maxima change when the slit separation is increased?}

		Similar to the argument for a single slit, Equation~\ref{eq:dbl_slit_distance} shows that $d$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, and thus increasing the slit separation $d$ lowers the distance ($2y$) between maxima.

		\item \textit{How does the distance between maxima change when the slit width is increased?}

		Changing the slit width only affects the shape of the envelope, and does not effectively change the distance between maxima at all. Increasing the width causes the envelope to drop off more sharply, lowering the intensity of the maxima of order 1 and above.

		\item \textit{How does the distance to the first minima in the diffraction envelope change when the slit separation is increased?}

		The slit separation has no effect on the diffraction envelope. The effect of increasing the slit separation is to create more closely spaced maxima within each envelope, without changing the distance between the envelope peaks.

		\item \textit{How does the distance to the first minima of the diffraction envelope change when the slit width is increased?}

		As the slit width is increased, the minima of the diffraction envelope move closer to the center, while the number of minima within each envelope are unchanged.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item \textit{What are the similarities and difference between the single slit and double slit patterns?}
